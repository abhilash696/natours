# Natours Application

This is an fully functional tour booking application purely designed to test my full stack web development technologies.Here we can perform several client-side operations such as login/logout,registering to the website,surfing thorugh multiple pages,booking a tour,reviewing a tour and so on..

When it comes to backend of the website,it ticks all the requirements starting from "authenticating a user before giving any kind of access","encrypting a passowrd before storing it into database","dealing with jwt webtokens and cookies","Email handling","Settingup payment process" and so on.

so backend is a complete API,which serves all the required needs that a website like natours should have.

Technologies:
1.Express.js
2.Node.js
3.Mongoose and MongoDB
4.Html
5.Css
